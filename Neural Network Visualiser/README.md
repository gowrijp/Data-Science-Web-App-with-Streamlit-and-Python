<h3>Project on creating neural network visualiser web app.</h3>  
<br>

- Create a model server with Flask and Keras  
- Create a web application with Streamlit  
- Utilize Keras' functional API  

1. Simple neural network with 2 hidden layers and one output layer and we will visualise the output values from all the nodes in each layer. 
We will create a simple server with flask to serve the neural network model for inference, a simple web app with streamlit and we will use 
keras functional api to get outputs of hidden layers in addition to the output layer.   
2. Here we are not exploring the theory behind the functioning of neural networks.    
3. Each box represents a node in a layer and the darker the node image, lower is the output of that node. So completely black would mean 0 and 
completely white would mean 1.   
4. Here we are using the MNIST dataset to train the model.
